# Apple Music Discord RPC
Discord RPC Client for Apple Music


## Disclaimer

A lot of the techniques used here have taken inspiration heavily from [this repo](https://github.com/NextFire/apple-music-discord-rpc). A lot of what I did wouldn't have been possible without the ideas from their particular implementation. 

## Why

In the repo mentioned before, I faced many issues with the album artwork not being the right one, and that kinda annoyed me. So I thought there might be a better way to do the same things that they did in the original repo. 

## Some Problems

Getting the artwork is the biggest problem, everything else is relatively straightforward. There is no way to get the URL of the current song playing (atleast from my research) through AppleScript (or JXA, Javascript for Automation, which is Apple's AppleScript implementation but in Javascript)

## Installation

Will be updated once I get it installed properly myself
